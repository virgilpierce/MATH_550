Questions you will explore this summer: What is statistics and what are data? What is randomness and how do we describe long-run behavior? How do we describe our data? How do we make decisions from data? How do we use more data to update our decisions? Can we use these ideas to do computations in other areas of mathematics? 2.4 Programing Statistics is best experienced through doing the work rather than concentrating on theory and as such we need to use software for the course to do the necessary computations. This course will serve as an introduction to the statistics software R, which is widely used for statistical computations. It is freely available, open source, and has an extensive collection of help online for it. If you are new to programming, R is a great place to learn because most of the tasks we do will involve just a few lines of commands. No priror knowledge of programming is assumed. The course materials are being written in R and are available in Github for you at this link: https://github.com/virgilpierce/MATH_550 From there you can download individual files from the class or the entire course as a Zip file. Updates will be pushed to that site as they are prepared. To access R and the editing software I recommend for using R, RStudio, you have options: You can download Rstudio including R for your Windows or Mac computer by going here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Be sure to choose the free option - you will not need the paid versions. If you do not want to or cannot install Rstudio on your computer (for example if you are using a Tablet or Chromebook) you can use cocalc to run R commands: https://cocalc.com You can log in to the Apporto Virtual Server https://unco.apporto.com/ with your UNC credentials and run Rstudio there. 2.5 Course Pre-requisites Students are expected to have experience with Calculus 1 and 2. 2.6 Course Goals Students will develop ways of thinking about data that will guide them as critical consumers of statistics in 2021 and beyond. Students will develop coherent meanings for specific statistical concepts (and mathematical concepts) so that the use of the statistics becomes useful in their academic, professional, and personal lives. Students will improve their problem-solving abilities. Students will make logical and verbal arguments in support of their conclusions. 2.7 Course Structure Class will be a mixture of class discussion and group work. If you have been in my classes before it will be a familiar format. We will use Google Docs to collaborate during class, but you may be asked to share your screen to show the computation in R that you are doing. You will need to be current on the homework for class in order to participate effectively in class. Collected work will be based on the discussion from class. 2.8 Our compact with each other Our agreement is: Speak with Meaning - reference the attributes and using names for quantities and qualities (and people). Exhibit Intellectual Integrity - base your conjecture on a logical foundation; do not pretend to an understanding. We are all still learning, and admiting that is an important step forward. Strive to Make Sense - persist in making sense of your peer’s thinking. Almost every problem we do in class has a variety of approaches and a variety of answers. Respect the Learning Process of All - allow others time to think, reflect, and construct. Pose questions of others. 2.9 Assignments Projects: There will be two take home projects and a final project. You will have at least five days to complete these. They will be partly computational, and partly reflective. They will also have components that are unique to each individual. They are open notes, and in particular any resource online about using R is available provided it is not in the format of a Q&amp;A. If at all in doubt about a resource you have found, please ask. All resources used should be cited. Homework: The homework is posed with the intent that you will collaborate with others on it, and you are encouraged to do so. Your instructor is available during the week to consult with as well. Questions: You will occasionally be asked to compose a question for others in the class. These assignments will be collected during class. You will provide your question with a description of how it should be solved (from your point of view) and how it address the goal or concept. Evidence of Learning: Your grade in the class is going to be based on your progress towards answering the questions posed in the Course Description. Evidence will naturally come from your submissions for the three types of assignments above, however you are encouraged to consider other evidence that could be provided. 2.10 Grades Your grade will be based upon the 4 assignment types above and the extent to which they contain evidence that the course goals have been met. Exceding expectations on all four course goals will result in a grade of A; a grade of B will mean that all of the course goals were met and on at least one the expectation was exceeded; a grade of C will mean that all of the course goals were met; a grade of D will mean that some of the course goals were met but not all of them; and a grade of F will mean that none of the course goals were met. 2.11 UNCO Policy Statements 2.11.1 Disability Resources It is the policy and practice of the University of Nothern Colorado to create inclusive learning environments - including this class. If there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that present barriers to your inclusion or to an accurate assessment of your achievement [learning] such as time-limited exams, inaccessible web content, or use of videos without captions, please communicate this with your professor and contact Disability Support Services (DSS) at (970) 351-2289, Michener Library L-80 to request accommodations. Students can learn more about the accomodation process at https://www.unco.edu/disability-resource-center/accomodations/ 2.11.2 Food Insecurity and Basic Needs Research shows that college students experience food insecurity at higher rates than the American household rate, and that food insecurity can negatively impact academic performance and persistence. In recognition of this problem, UNC offers assistance to students facing food insecurity through an on-campus food pantry. The Bear Pantry is located in University Center 2166A, and is open for regular hours throughout the semester. Please visit http://www.unco.edu/bear-pantry for more information. Any student who faces challenges securing their food or housing and believes this may affect their performance in the course is also urged to contact Student Outreach and Support (SOS) for assistance. SOS can assist students during difficult circumstances which may include medical, mental health, personal or family crisis, illness or injury. SOS can be reached at sos@unco.edu or via phone at 970-351-2796. 2.11.3 Honor Code All members of the Univeristy of Northern Colorado community are entrustred with the responsibility to uphold and promote five fundamental values: Honesty, Trust, Respect, Fairness, and Responsibility. These core elements foster an atmosphere, insite and outside the classroom, which serves as a foundation and guides the UNC community’s academic, professional, and personal growth. Endorsement of these core elements by students, faculty, staff, administration, and trustees strengthens the integrity and value of our academic climate. 2.11.4 UNC’s Policies There are more university policies not printed here, but published in the course catalog, university regulations, and the UNC Board of Trustees Policy Manual. In particular we will follow UNC’s polices and recomendations for academic misconduct. For additional information, please see the Student Code of Conduct at the Dean of Student’s website: http://wwww.unco.edu/dos/Conduct/codeofconduct.html. In the case of academic appeals, university procedures will be followed. For information on academic appeals see: https://www.unco.edu/trustees/pdf/board-policy-manual.pdf.

Our first unit will cover: How and why we will be using R in this course. A discussion of What is Statistics? A discussion of the differences between Exploratory versus Confirmatory analysis An overview of some of the problems we will develop tools to answer in this course 3.1 Introduction and R This course is going to use R for the computations. Much of what we do could be computed using Excell or Google Sheets however R has certain advantages over these tools: R is a purpose built statistics software. It is designed to do that really well. R arguably is the best tool for producing good looking figures suitable for publications. The figures are easy to manipulate and adjust. Most importantly it is really easy to have your figures be consistently formatted, something that is much harder with spreadsheets. R includes a markdown language for creating nice looking notebooks: It can be used as an all in one publication tool to produce a report or paper with statistical analysis. R is an industry standard tool for doing statistics. and most importantly R is open and free. You can download it, and the tools we will use to interact with it Rstudio for free. It is also possible to use R in online environments like Cocalc. If you are teaching a statistics class for your high school or college, I highly recommend using R as part of your class. 3.1.1 What do you need To get started: If you are using a Mac or PC you should download a copy of RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/ the free version is all you will need. This includes a copy of R itself - Rstudio is a tool for interacting with R to make some of our tasks easier. If you are using a Chromebook or want to use R on a tablet I have two options for you: Cocalc provides an online interface that lets you issue R commands. It also includes a markdown language so you will be able to use it to prepare the documents for class. You can reach it here: https://cocalc.com/ you will need to create an account. The university Apporto virtual machine: https://unco.apporto.com has R studio installed. You can log in to it from any browser. If at all possible I would recomend 1. as with the software installed locally you will not need to be using your internet connection. However students using 2. in my classes have reported that it works well for them. 3.1.2 Open Rstudio To actually start using R, go ahead and open R studio. You can use R directly in the console (lower-left quadrant) however I recommend interacting with it in a Notebook as this provides you with: an easy way to modify inputs and execute them again. an easy way to save your work to return to it later or to copy and paste it to a new notebook. the ability to add markdown explaining what you are doing. The button on the top-left of the tool bar is for openning new documents, click the triangle next to it and choose “New Notebook” form the menu. RStudio helpfully inserts some information setting up your new notebook. You can adjust it as you wish. You can save the document from the file menu or using the toolbar buttons. RStudio has provided an example of how to put in Markdown language, and how to put in R commands. You execute a section of R commands but putting the cursor inside of it and pressing “Control+Enter”. Try it now on the plot(cars) command. plot(cars) 3.1.3 A few words about programming languages Before we continue with the Probability and Statistics I want to just add that learning programming languages is a powerful tool to help your students advance in their thinking about mathematics, one that I worry we do not spend enough time working with students on. At UNC one of my main goals for my tenure as School Director is to incorporate Python and R into the undergraduate mathematics curriculum wherever we can. A key part of learning a programming language, or more accurately, the only thing that has ever worked for me is having a problem I am interested in that needs solving. Statistics for myself, I hope for you by the end of this course, and for your students could be that problem that motivates learning some programing. Independently of all of that R is a great language to start with for the following reasons: Because R is so fundamentally focused on statistics and visualizations of data, it is simpler and more compact than a general language. R is human readable - you can usually read a statement outloud and you will know exactly what it is doing. R is free. If you are interested in more about how to introduce students to R in a statistics class, or Python in an algebra, trigonometry, or calculus class, please let me know. It is a topic I am very interested in advancing further to students elsewhere. 3.1.4 A first example How many students were in each of your classes this Spring? While I am collecting this data you can reflect on this funny musing. I grew up in rural Vermont and one thing I remember learning as a child was that asking a farmer how many cows they had was very rude, equivalent to asking how much money they had. I’ve always felt a bit strange asking other teachers how many students they have because of this. # for testing use this students &lt;- round(rnorm(20, 25, 5)) # for class use this # students &lt;- {} students ## [1] 25 25 30 19 23 31 29 27 20 26 26 25 25 23 30 35 28 25 22 27 R Notes: lists in R are enclosed in curly braces and each member of the list is separated by a semi-colon or a space; note I think leaving the space is bad practice and recommend not using that feature. In this case our list is a collection of integers. Lists can more generally be numbers or strings or even lists of lists. Comments in commands start with hash symbols. Another syntax note: R uses both = and &lt;- for assignment. They both work as you would expect, however &lt;- has some nice positives in the detailed differences and it is worth getting into the habit of using it. RStudio Note: You might notice that the variable we have just created has appeared in the upper-right quadrant of RStudio. 3.1.4.1 Summary Statistics To get started we can use summary to get an overview of what our list of student enrollments look like. Review the meaning of each of these. summary(students) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 19.00 24.50 25.50 26.05 28.25 35.00 Mean and Median are measures of center, while the quartiles are measures of spread. One measure of spread missing is the variance or its square root standard deviation: var(students); sqrt(var(students)) ## [1] 14.57632 ## [1] 3.817894 The variance is computed by taking the sum of the square differences between the data and the mean and then dividing that by number of items minus one; we will explain why this is what we divide by later in class. In the code blocks below I will add some comments about what we are doing: # define a variable for the mean we will consistently use bar for sample mean # again note I use the &lt;- assignment rather than = ybar &lt;- mean(students) # R can then do the arithmetic and when we combine a list of numbers with a single number and square it, it knows what we mean. (students - ybar)^2 ## [1] 1.1025 1.1025 15.6025 49.7025 9.3025 24.5025 8.7025 0.9025 36.6025 0.0025 0.0025 1.1025 1.1025 9.3025 15.6025 80.1025 3.8025 1.1025 16.4025 0.9025 # Then as we said, we sum over all of these and then divide by the number of them # minus 1 sum( (students - ybar)^2 ) / ( length(students) - 1 ) ## [1] 14.57632 Note why we compute variance in this way. We are trying to understand how far the data moves from the mean \\(\\bar{y}\\). However we can’t just sum over the differences as that will just add up to zero: sum(students - ybar ) ## [1] -1.421085e-14 We have choices though, we could sum over the absolute value and indeed that does give us a notion of spread. However the advantage of summing over the squares is that it brings in tools from Calculus that work with quadratic expressions but not with absolute value expressions. We then intend to take an average. For reasons we will justify later, it turns out the correct average to do is to divide by the size of our sample minus 1: \\(n-1\\) is called the degrees of freedom (roughly computing \\(\\bar{y}\\) from the sample has used up one degree of freedom). Note the units on these two statistics: the variance is the average of the sum of the squares (by the number of degrees of freedom) so its units are the square of the units of our sample data (students squared in this case); and then the standard deviation is the square root of the variance and so has units of the original data (students in this case). 3.2 Plots That’s all fine and good, but a picture (or two) is worth a thousand words and probably tens of thousands of computations. Let’s introduce ourselves to two types of plots: 3.2.1 Histograms Histograms are made by binning the data and then drawing bars whose height is the number of data points in each bin. They give us a visualization of the distribution of our data: Taller bars mean more of the data was near those values. hist(students, 10) Note you can adjust the number of bins to use. R tries to guess the labels from the names of the data. You can output the image to a file by right clicking on it, by using the export command in the plot tab in the lower-right quadrant of RStudio or by using a command in the console in the lower-left quadrant. Of course if you are using Markdown to compose you text you don’t need to export the figure, you have it right here. Note the connection to the numerical summaries we have: The mean gives the center of mass of the histogram, while the variance (or standard deviation describes how much it spreads out from there). 3.2.2 BoxPlot Boxplots are a visual representation of the quartile and median statistics for our data: boxplot(students, horizontal=TRUE) # Note the use of = for a parameter instead of &lt;- To interpret boxplots you should think in terms of quartiles: Half of the data is in the box. Half of the data is to either side of the median. 3.3 Numerical versus Categorical Data The class sizes data is an example of numerical data. Another type of data used frequently is categorical cata: Note if you are running this code, you will need to download the “Supermarket Transactions.xlsx” file from Github or here. We will also need to use the tidy package. You may need to install this package using install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;); ## Error in install.packages : Updating loaded packages Then you will need to load the package: library(readxl) library(ggplot2) supermarket &lt;- read_excel(&quot;Supermarket Transactions.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 2) supermarket ## # A tibble: 14,059 x 16 ## Transaction `Purchase Date` `Customer ID` Gender `Marital Status` Homeowner Children `Annual Income` City `State or Provin… Country `Product Family` `Product Depart… `Product Catego… ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 2011-12-18 00:00:00 7223 F S Y 2 $30K - $50K Los An… CA USA Food Snack Foods Snack Foods ## 2 2 2011-12-20 00:00:00 7841 M M Y 5 $70K - $90K Los An… CA USA Food Produce Vegetables ## 3 3 2011-12-21 00:00:00 8374 F M N 2 $50K - $70K Bremer… WA USA Food Snack Foods Snack Foods ## 4 4 2011-12-21 00:00:00 9619 M M Y 3 $30K - $50K Portla… OR USA Food Snacks Candy ## 5 5 2011-12-22 00:00:00 1900 F S Y 3 $130K - $150K Beverl… CA USA Drink Beverages Carbonated Beve… ## 6 6 2011-12-22 00:00:00 6696 F M Y 3 $10K - $30K Beverl… CA USA Food Deli Side Dishes ## 7 7 2011-12-23 00:00:00 9673 M S Y 2 $30K - $50K Salem OR USA Food Frozen Foods Breakfast Foods ## 8 8 2011-12-25 00:00:00 354 F M Y 2 $150K + Yakima WA USA Food Canned Foods Canned Soup ## 9 9 2011-12-25 00:00:00 1293 M M Y 3 $10K - $30K Bellin… WA USA Non-Consumable Household Cleaning Suppli… ## 10 10 2011-12-25 00:00:00 7938 M S N 1 $50K - $70K San Di… CA USA Non-Consumable Health and Hygi… Pain Relievers ## # … with 14,049 more rows, and 2 more variables: Units Sold &lt;dbl&gt;, Revenue &lt;dbl&gt; "]]
